# Comparison on RetinaNet and Faster R-CNN

- `mask-detection-app.py`: main file which is executed with `streamlit run mask-detection-app.py`

- `input.py`: algorithm for predicting image input files, similar to forward function in PyTorch

- `data.py`: data structures that contain file paths to sample images

- `retinanet.py`: functions for building and predicting with RetinaNet
